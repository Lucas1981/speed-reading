# Speed Reader

This app will display any text you feed it as a .txt file word for word with a set interval in miliseconds between the words. The idea is that when you play the text and watch the words, you will supposedly read them faster than if you were to read them from paper. It was inspired by the Tony Buzan's Speed Reading book, laying emphasis on the time lost when "jumping" across the page, "resting" on certain words and even "backtracking" to words you already read sort of as a tic. This app eliminates all of this automatically.

The app is built using Vue, TypeScript, Bootstrap, Webpack and Babel.
